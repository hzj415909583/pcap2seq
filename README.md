Overview
========

Converts [pcap files](http://wiki.wireshark.org/Development/LibpcapFileFormat) to Hadoop Sequence files.

Processing pcap files with Hadoop MapReduce is inefficent since pcap files are not splittable, so a single hadoop worker processes the whole pcap file even if the file spans multiple blocks.

Converting pcap to sequence file format creates a splittable and compressable file that can be processed using multiple hadoop workers. 


Build
========
The project requires [gradle](http://www.gradle.org/downloads)
To build it, clone the repository then run :
```
gradle clean jar
```
Execute
========
The build process creates a jar file in build/libs/

Run the jar using hadoop binary with three arguments :

1 - input pcap file (A local file on the machine)

2 - name of output file (file:///home/user/outputfile.seq for local filesystem or outputfile.seq for HDFS)

3 - compression : you can use block level compression in sequence file by setting this argument to 'org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.GzipCodec' or 'org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.BZip2Codec' to use a specific codec.
For no compression set this argument to 'none'

Example :
```
hadoop jar pcap2seq-1.2.jar file.pcap file.seq org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.BZip2Codec
```

Converts file.pcap to file.seq with block level compression using GZIP. The output file will be stored in HDFS.

Note : You should have native hadoop libraries to use compression.
